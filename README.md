# c_vuln_scanner
This was a five person project done with Jacob Beaman, Rebecca Gee, Ansh Shah, and Hannah Scott. The purpose of the program was to take a .c file as input and identify vulnerabilities related to the "gets" function (instead of using "fgets") and unsafe use of arrays. The program would then describe that vulnerability in terms of a MITRE technique (i.e., DOS or Memory Injection) Our main priorities were to further expand on our knowledge of C as a programming language as well as identifiying some simple vulnerabilities in source code.

NOTE: the regex identifing vulnerabilities in arrays needs to be updated to reduce the number of false positives.
